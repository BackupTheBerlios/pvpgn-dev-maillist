<PRE>Bug #11959, was updated on 2007-Sep-08 23:21
Here is a current snapshot of the bug.

Project: Player vs Player Gaming Network
Category: IRC
Status: Open
Resolution: None
Bug Group: bnetd
Priority: 5
Submitted by: riffruff
Assigned to : pelish
Summary: IRC Ban

Details: When someone is banned on IRC, they are not exactly &quot;kicked&quot; out of the channel...

I was on IRC, and tried kicking myself via Starcraft Brood War game.  When kicked, on IRC, I still saw everyone in the channel, and there was no indication I was kicked.  I didn't recieve messages sent from anyone anymore though.

If I sent a message, it would still display in the channel I was previously in.

Now, on Starcraft brood war, it said I was kicked, as it should, and it didn't show me in channel anymore, yet I could still see text from the IRC of me being displayed in the channel.

Comment:
Let me add more info about the irc problem :

In some cases when you join a channel/server with irc you aren't really connected it's hard to explain with words but whathever you kick/ban the user id aint kicked no matter what and you got to kill his connection from server in order to remove him from the channel.

Take our server for example (eurobattle.net) we hosted irc base chat in our forum and whathever a user join in channel with IRC we cant really kick or ban then with /kick or /ban commands and they are invulnerable to quota.
I mean they are able to send infinite messages whiout getting the red message.

This possible happens cause when you connect with irc from the forum you're using forum IP not your IP and you're using a unique ID not your own one.

There are more bugs with irc so i sugest you disable irc in your server while it's fixed here.
