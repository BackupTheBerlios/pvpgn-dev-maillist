Hi tazz,

I've checked the log and found nothing about this, under lower log level. 

I will change the log level to all and take a test again this weekend.

Hey babalala,

What about the logs during all of this - anything juicy in there ?

I will see if I can get some guys together to do a 10 man load - otherwise I will do a 3 client load :)

Laterz !

Hi tazz,

I just tried do not name the rehost game, but as you seeing in the screeshot below, it failed. And also I failed to name the rehost game 'pvpgn test ~~~~~' which is same with the original game. What's more, I could not join the host which was rehosted by other players...:(

Hey Babalala,

I also just noted that the game name changed...it was pvpgn test ~~~~ or something like that, yet the rehost is 254.

When I &quot;re-hosted&quot; the game, I didn't name it so war3 took the one from the file - try it like that perhaps ?

Hey Babalala,

Was 254 the original game name that you entered ? Also - can the other guy host the game ? See what game name he has for it.

Thanks !

Hey Babalala,

I would suggest that you make screenshots like I did showing the fault. I think I understand what you are saying but that doesn't make sence to me, since the kicking code there is handled by war3.

Like I said before as well, I think that war3 thinks you are another player, instead of the real on and hence kicks you out.

Think about it, PVPGN doesn't save any info about the game when you save it, so how can it kick someone 2-3 days down the line.

Anyways, make some screenshots and let's see what happens.

Hi tazz,

Thanks for your quick response.

I have used PVPGN for a long time:), and I understand the things what your have said, PVPGN is just a platform for client to connect and do nothing when the connections establish successfully.

But as I have said in submission &quot;the saved game(the game was saved on PVPGN) could be loaded at other platform(such as LAN and any other lobby like GG)&quot;. So the problem must be caused by PVPGN. I'm worring about that the code on 'join saved game' was ignored just because the save/load is not used so frequently and results in two clients connect failed when load game via PVPGN.

What's more, plz pay attention on what tp_moonstar said, he must notice this bug not only me.

Hope you could verify this issue ASAP.

Thanks.

Hey babalala,

Like I said before, as long as all the machines where in the same game with the same nicks it will work - we have loaded some dota maps before and all 10 players re-joined without a problem.

What you are saying sounds like the users are getting kicked out because they either don't have the saved game or war3 thinks they are someone else.

PVPGN doesn't really par-take in the loading and saving of the games. Please keep in mind that PVPGN/BNETD is more like a lobby (with regards to war3) when it comes to the games.

Once the connection has been made to the hoster, PVPGN is no longer in the picture, as a matter of fact, PVPGN can't kick you from a game. Well - it can on it's side (so it will show that you are not in *a* game), but your client will still be connected and in the game.

All the kicking/joining/etc. happens between the clients (with the exception of ladder games I think, but we are dealing only with custom games here :) )

Having just re-read your request, you are saying that &quot;other players can't join in&quot;, well, as I said above, that is a war3 &quot;feature/bug&quot; not a PVPGN problem.

PVPGN's work ends once the game is created and shown to the rest of the players.

Hi tp_moonstar,

Are you sure about that pvpgn does not &quot;support save/load&quot;? And could this should be a new work?

Thanks.

Hi tazz,

It's indeed working all right when there is just one single player.

The bug is:
&quot;other players could not join in&quot; the saved game.

You could try to follow the steps below:
1. Start a custom game on pvpgn with several other players.(two players will be enough)
2. Save the game.
3. Load the game which saved just now.
4. Other players played with you can't join the loaded game. In host's chat window display this: &quot;xxx has joined. xxx has left.&quot;, actual the player xxx never joined the game successfully.

And I will show the screenshots later.

Thanks and BR.

Hey,

Forgot to add - you need to use the same computers that where in the game when you saved it - I have tried copying over the saved game to the other computers but this doesn't work - I didn't spend to much time on getting it to work since this has never been an issue in my life.

Laterz !

Hey,

Sorry for the delay but here are some screenshot made with war3 1.21 and pvpgn 1.8.0 (windows based server - not that it matters since they share the same code :) )

Maybe you can make some screenshots and show us where it fails ?

Hi tazz,

You could not reproduced this issue?

I tested on both windows server and linux server, under pvpgn v1.8.0, DotA maps, war3 TFT1.21 just now and failed each time.

And, what's more, I had found the bug since the period when using war3 TFT 1.18. So, plz check this issue.

Unfortunatly, I am living in China PRC with terrible net that I'm afraid that you could not access with my server. However, here is the address: war3.byr.edu.cn(211.68.71.72).

If necessary, I could provide the image of this issue. And I will try to catch the logs these days.

BR and Thanks.

Hi,

I just tried this on pvpgn ver 1.8.0 final release (Windows server,two clients,custom map) and I could save and load fine.

Please can you provide more details (version of war3,version of server,server address) so that I can test and re-create the problem.

Thanks.
