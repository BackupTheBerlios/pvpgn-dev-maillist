New Revision: 382

Added:
   trunk/pvpgn/README.cmake
Log:
Added basic build instructions with cmake. There is still much left to 
be said, such as how to deal with the various include/libraries on 
non-UNIX systems.

+                      PvPGN CMake Build Instructions
+                    ===================================
+
+
+
+0. Getting &quot;cmake&quot;
+
+   Before anything you need to make sure you have a cmake (at least version
+2.4.3) installed on the system you wish to compile PvPGN. On Linux/*BSD systems 
+this sould probably be provided by your package system one way or another or 
+you could try to build cmake from source. Follow the &quot;Readme.txt&quot; from cmake 
+sources if you are going over that path.
+
+   Another source of &quot;cmake&quot; may be the binary packages provided by the 
+cmake people on www.cmake.org. This is usually the way to get it on 
+Windows or exotic Unices. For BeOS you could get it from bebits.com.
+
+   Please note that &quot;cmake&quot; is not a build system by itself but rather a 
+&quot;meta&quot; build system. Parsing the cmake input files, cmake will generate 
+the build system files to use with your build system (which may be a 
+classic Unix style &quot;make&quot; or an IDE such as Visual Studio). cmake calls 
+the part of it that generates the project files a &quot;generator&quot; (and is 
+configurable).
+
+
+1. Running &quot;cmake&quot;
+
+   Now that you have cmake (and also you have the pvpgn sources with the 
+cmake support) you should try to run cmake to generate the project files 
+(or makefiles, depending on your generator used with cmake). It is 
+recommended that you do an &quot;out of source&quot; build, this means you should 
+not try to build pvpgn inside the source directory but in a directory 
+specially made for building pvpgn.
+
+   Note: the instructions generally follow how to use the cmake command 
+line version which is more portable (available everywhere cmake is 
+available). For using various cmake GUIs one has to find out himself how 
+they work.
+
+   Create a build directory (preferably have it empty), change current 
+directory there, run cmake as &quot;cmake /path/to/pvpgn-src&quot; where 
+&quot;/path/to/pvpgn-src&quot; is obvioulsy the path to the pvpgn source 
+directory. This will have cmake generate the type of project files that 
+is default for your platform (which is &quot;Unix Makefiles&quot; on Unix/Linux 
+systems or &quot;Visual Studio Project files&quot; on Windows) without any 
+additional storage types (ie. no SQL support) and will install pvpgn on 
+&quot;make install&quot; in the default location (which is &quot;/usr/local&quot; for Unix 
+systems or &quot;&lt;System-Drive&gt;:\\Program Files\\pvpgn&quot; on Windows).
+
+   All these defaults are probably not what you wanted so cmake offers a 
+way to customize this by command line flags setting variables or 
+selecting the project files generator. Here are some useful options:
+
+   -G &quot;Project Type&quot; : tells cmake to use the &quot;Project Type&quot; project 
+files generator; on Unix systems this is by default &quot;Unix Makefiles&quot; and 
+on Windows &quot;Visual Studio project files&quot;; other useful values are 
+&quot;KDevelop3&quot;, &quot;MinGW Makefiles&quot; or &quot;MSYS Makefiles&quot; (the last 2 are 
+obviously valid only on Windows)
+
+   -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=&quot;/path/to&quot; : it will tell cmake to set 
+accordingly values so that on &quot;make install&quot; it will install relative to 
+&quot;/path/to&quot;
+
+   -D WITH_MYSQL : it will tell cmake to check for MySQL 
+headers/libraries and if present prepare project files able to compile 
+PvPGN with MySQL
+
+   -D WITH_PGSQL or -D WITH_SQLITE3 are similar to WITH_MYSQL but for 
+PostgreSQL/SQLite3 storage support
+
+   WARNING: in between 2 cmake runs make sure you remove all build files 
+or at least remove the CMakeCache.txt file otherwise you may experience 
+strange problems.
+
+2. Building PvPGN
+
+    After successfully running cmake you are ready to build pvpgn. 
+Depending on your project files generator used with cmake you do this in 
+various ways. Example: when using &quot;Unix Makefiles&quot; you should just issue 
+&quot;make&quot; and it should build your pvpgn binaries. When using some IDE 
+project file types such as KDevelop3 or Visual Studio you should run the 
+&quot;Build&quot; command of that IDE.
+
+3. Installing PvPGN
+
+
+   Again, depending on the type of project files generator you used you 
+can install pvpgn to the CMAKE_INSTALL_DIR prefixed location. When using 
+the &quot;Unix Makefiles&quot; generator you can use &quot;make install&quot; to do so.
+
+
+4. Full examples usage
+
+4.1 Using cmake on a Unix/Linux system installing pvpgn under &quot;~pvpgn&quot; 
+with MySQL support
+
+  $ cd pvpgn-build
+  $ cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_DIR=/home/pvpgn -D WITH_MYSQL ../pvpgn-src
+  $ make
+  $ make install
+
+4.2 Using cmake on a Windows (command line prompt) system with mingw32
+  &gt; cd pvpgn-build
+  &gt; cmake ..\pvpgn-src
+  &gt; mingw32-make
+  &gt; mingw32-make install
+
+4. Problems
+
+
+   cmake building in PvPGN is a young feature as such many issues may 
+still arise. If you have problems with cmake please contact us at 
<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/pvpgn-dev">+pvpgn-dev at berlios.de</A> (after you subscribe to the mailing list at 
+<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/pvpgn-dev">https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/pvpgn-dev</A>) or use the bug 
+tracker at <A HREF="http://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?group_id=2291">http://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?group_id=2291</A> .
+
+   When reporting problems please provide all information such as pvpgn 
+version, your platform name/version, exactly what you tried to do (the 
+commands used) and exactly the errors you get.
