<PRE>Bug #10741, was updated on 2007-Mar-26 23:10
Here is a current snapshot of the bug.

Project: Player vs Player Gaming Network
Category: Warcraft Series
Status: Open
Resolution: None
Bug Group: None
Priority: 5
Submitted by: shakar
Assigned to : none
Summary: Tournaments

Details: Hello, I'm admin at eurobattle.net server, [server.eurobattle.net with PvPGN 1.99.0-SVN version]. Recently, we made a new tournaments' system which allows users to sign up, play their games and upload the replay, advancing to the next phase (if they won), plus, they get a win/lose on tournaments at web ladder. We wanted to give wins and loses to users at server via /set, which doesn't work properly, just gives them the icons, though it seems that server does not record the icons, and when server restarts, they lose their icon...we know htat pvpgn does not support tournaments' stuff, but it should keep the icons...and maybe the wins/loses via /set.
What can we do to solve this problem?
thanks in advance.

@shakar:
You damn ungrateful bastard. 
This is an open source project - we for sure don't have a budget to &quot;buy&quot; patches. 
You ever heard of the concept of &quot;taking and giving&quot;?
You take the open source software - you give back some of your improvements?
Seems like you don't.

Get Lost.
And don't even think about coming back and asking for help/support.

we have added the keys into the record like the one above
and it still doesnt show them...
and it dont save to db by set command.
also if you insert it to db manually
and even restarting pvpn doesn't help
pvpgn don't see this value

what can we do to fix it?
