Subject: [pvpgn-dev] [Bug #10741] Tournaments

Bug #10741, was updated on 2007-Mar-26 23:10
Here is a current snapshot of the bug.

Project: Player vs Player Gaming Network
Category: Warcraft Series
Status: Open
Resolution: None
Bug Group: None
Priority: 5
Submitted by: shakar
Assigned to : none
Summary: Tournaments

Details: Hello, I'm admin at eurobattle.net server, [server.eurobattle.net
with PvPGN 1.99.0-SVN version]. Recently, we made a new tournaments' system
which allows users to sign up, play their games and upload the replay,
advancing to the next phase (if they won), plus, they get a win/lose on
tournaments at web ladder. We wanted to give wins and loses to users at
server via /set, which doesn't work properly, just gives them the icons,
though it seems that server does not record the icons, and when server
restarts, they lose their icon...we know htat pvpgn does not support
tournaments' stuff, but it should keep the icons...and maybe the wins/loses
via /set.
What can we do to solve this problem?
thanks in advance.

I'm sorry?
do I have to share everything I do? 
the soulotion for the problem I submitted here I shared with u-238, and
everyone who want to explanations how to add tournament records + icons is
free to ask me personally... and I will give. 

but my tournament project? <A HREF="http://ladder.eurobattle.net/tour.php">http://ladder.eurobattle.net/tour.php</A>
I worked hard for making this, and surly I wont just toss it away to others.
that project is what makes my server uniqe.
opensource? no ... it's not.
I dont mind replacing it with other uniqe things which other admins made...
or for real money transfered into the server.

ah, yes...
about this &quot;help/support&quot; which you are talking about..
I never got an answer for anything which I asked.
this site it kinda useless...
so I dont really need to bother coming here to waste my time

idiot

@shakar:
You damn ungrateful bastard. 
This is an open source project - we for sure don't have a budget to &quot;buy&quot;
patches. 
You ever heard of the concept of &quot;taking and giving&quot;?
You take the open source software - you give back some of your improvements?
Seems like you don't.

Get Lost.
And don't even think about coming back and asking for help/support.

we have added the keys into the record like the one above
and it still doesnt show them...
and it dont save to db by set command.
also if you insert it to db manually
and even restarting pvpn doesn't help
pvpgn don't see this value

what can we do to fix it?
