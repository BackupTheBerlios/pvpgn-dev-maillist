<PRE>Bug #10745, was updated on 2007-Mar-27 11:50
Here is a current snapshot of the bug.

Project: Player vs Player Gaming Network
Category: Westwood Online
Status: Open
Resolution: None
Bug Group: bnetd
Priority: 5
Submitted by: mixman
Assigned to : pelish
Summary: p2p connection problem with Tiberian Sun

Details: &quot;Connection to player lost&quot; message appears after starting the game. Server connect/join works fine but then starting game player cant connect to another player. One player is connecting from outside another from inside network, ports are forwarded but outside player client gets invalid address another player &quot;10.0.0.2&quot; this is internal address of the network pc. On the gateway 10.0.0.1 is pvpgn server that handles both inside/outside connections. Starcraft works fine but wol doesnt. Pvpgn version is 1.8.0 i think problem is with adress translation at handle_irc.c.

Comment:
Well. Your &quot;bug report&quot; is not bug at this time but is feature request. The problem is as you sayed in address translations of player IPs. This feature IS NOT supported at this time for player IP addresses but ONLY for server IP address. I will try to code it in future.

For all: at this time is possible to play on server beside the NAT but 100% will work only two situations: 1)all of players have private IP and can connect to server without any NAT,
2) all of players have public IP (server can work in beside NAT but need to have right configured address_translation.conf)
