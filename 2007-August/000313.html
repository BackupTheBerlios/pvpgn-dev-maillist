<PRE>Bug #11700, was updated on 2007-Aug-05 12:06
Here is a current snapshot of the bug.

Project: Player vs Player Gaming Network
Category: General
Status: Closed
Resolution: Fixed
Bug Group: bnetd
Priority: 5
Submitted by: megablue
Assigned to : pandaemonium
Summary: oversized login with #uid as username

Details: players are able to login with their user id by entering # and follow by thier user id as username. any CHAT client that didn't restricts the maximum number of character for username are able to login with a long user id with padded zeros.  Not sure it can be apply on other binary protocol or not. 

for example:
#0000000000000000000000000000000000001032

suggestion: 
please remove login from #uid completely. the dependancy of the #uid login might leads to serious security flaws.

Comment:
Issue has been fixed in both CVS and SVN.

#uid is now automagically truncated.

Also a new bnetd.conf option has been added (account_force_username) that (when set to true) will force loggeduser (which is used in all packets sent to represent the username) to the registered name of the account.


Whilest messing with all this I became aware of another possible issue. How do IRC/WOL clients feel about this issue? Needs further investigation....

Comment:
It might prove hard to completly remove that &quot;feature&quot; - but it might prove possible the #uid gets displayed &quot;as short as possible&quot;. (thus #0000000000000000000000000000000000001032 would resolve to #1032)
The version I'd prefer most would be to resolve numeric userIds to usernames anyways.

I'll look into it.

Comment:
also it will cause the pvpgn to send oversize username and make other binary clients disconnect when they visit the channel with a username showed in the exampel above.
