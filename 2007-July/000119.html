Hi tp_moonstar,

Are you sure about that pvpgn does not &quot;support save/load&quot;? And could this should be a new work?

Thanks.

Hi tazz,

It's indeed working all right when there is just one single player.

The bug is:
&quot;other players could not join in&quot; the saved game.

You could try to follow the steps below:
1. Start a custom game on pvpgn with several other players.(two players will be enough)
2. Save the game.
3. Load the game which saved just now.
4. Other players played with you can't join the loaded game. In host's chat window display this: &quot;xxx has joined. xxx has left.&quot;, actual the player xxx never joined the game successfully.

And I will show the screenshots later.

Thanks and BR.

Hey,

Forgot to add - you need to use the same computers that where in the game when you saved it - I have tried copying over the saved game to the other computers but this doesn't work - I didn't spend to much time on getting it to work since this has never been an issue in my life.

Laterz !

Hey,

Sorry for the delay but here are some screenshot made with war3 1.21 and pvpgn 1.8.0 (windows based server - not that it matters since they share the same code :) )

Maybe you can make some screenshots and show us where it fails ?

Hi tazz,

You could not reproduced this issue?

I tested on both windows server and linux server, under pvpgn v1.8.0, DotA maps, war3 TFT1.21 just now and failed each time.

And, what's more, I had found the bug since the period when using war3 TFT 1.18. So, plz check this issue.

Unfortunatly, I am living in China PRC with terrible net that I'm afraid that you could not access with my server. However, here is the address: war3.byr.edu.cn(211.68.71.72).

If necessary, I could provide the image of this issue. And I will try to catch the logs these days.

BR and Thanks.

Hi,

I just tried this on pvpgn ver 1.8.0 final release (Windows server,two clients,custom map) and I could save and load fine.

Please can you provide more details (version of war3,version of server,server address) so that I can test and re-create the problem.

Thanks.
