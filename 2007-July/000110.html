Thank you, waiting for your email.

&gt;<i> 2. You don't want to say that a mailing-list is a better way to contact that
</I>&gt;<i> forum?
</I>
Yes, I always thought that mailing lists are better than forums and I
still think so. For one thing the &quot;pain&quot; to subscribe and post to
mailing lists rather than web forums filters out people who talk on
forums just to say something (not something constructive). Generally
the information quality of the forum is 10 times lower than of a
mailing list so obviously I prefer the later. The mailing list
archives are better than searching on forums (in my experience finding
something useful on mailing lists has always been more successful than
finding something useful on various web forums).

&gt;<i> It can be good, yed but for developers, for talking about bugs, futures
</I>&gt;<i> etc.. but not for all peoples who use PvPGN software, and want to eg. check
</I>&gt;<i> some old discussed topics ( it's not able in mailing-list ).
</I>
Of course you can, that's why there are mailing list archives.

&gt;<i> Also I don't mean only forum ( we could start from this ), I was talking
</I>&gt;<i> about all staff like wiki, tracker (that was great things)
</I>
Yes I know you probably don't mean personally that the forums are the
pvpgn community is just I took the chance to state what I wanted
because even if you don't mean that a lot of people do seem to mean
it.

&gt;<i> But it's Your decision. I just said what I want to say...
</I>
Obviously that's why we write messages, to state our beliefs. There is
nothing wrong in arguing, actually that's the only way to evolve and
thus the only way to improve things.

I have not decided to not have forums at all (and I don't think that's
my decision anyway).
