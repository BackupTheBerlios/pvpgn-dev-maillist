<PRE>Bug #15482, was updated on 2009-Apr-04 23:47
Here is a current snapshot of the bug.

Project: Player vs Player Gaming Network
Category: Warcraft Series
Status: Open
Resolution: None
Bug Group: bnetd
Priority: 5
Submitted by: shakar
Assigned to : none
Summary: /clan create function - allow forbiden chars in clan tag

Details: Hi...
There is a slight problem with the clan create function.
Clan tag should allow only 'A-Z', 'a-z' and '0-9'
and sadly clan create doesn't check it, so clan tags having those chars: !@#$%^&amp;*()-_=+ are created too.
It's a bad thing since it makes problems while trying to read the clan tag from php to view on site.

You can always change minimum alowed users who will be able to create clan trough bnetd.conf.  This command alows WOL users to create clans. I realy dont want to remove this command. I just would like to fix all possible bugs as usual.

I'll basically reinforce what pandae has said, pvpgn is an emulation server with additional features as such:
1. are those characters allowed on battle.net or not? (ie is there any client to allow them?); if not, then we should not allow them either as there is the risk that characters not allowed that have been entered using non clients (like the /clan create command) will break the client when displaying them
2. if however they are allowed on battle.net then I couldn't care less about whatever tools there are out there that assumed other valid characters, they irrelevant to the decision if they should be allowed by pvpgn

So which is it?

I don't really care any more If this get fixed or not.
command disabled (for good) on EuroBattle.Net (and I advice to all other server to do this as well)
The idea that 2 users alone can create a clan is bad anyway. It only makes a mass and a lot of dead clans later.

my recommendation to you is to remove this part code from source - the command is bugged anyway.

you can close this bug If you like, doesn't matter for me anyway.

Sorry for being not clear enough - sure the issue should be fixed in PvPGN.
But still I'd consider this a non-critical issue for PvPGN, as it doesn't break anything (but compability). If any external scripts/applications break cause the made assumptions that aren't guaranteed - then whoever made them should fix them, too.

pandaemonium:
one of the most important programming rules you should have learned by now: you should never ever trust user input!

why are you telling this to me?
I didn't had any connection in creating that command...
anyway... doesn't matter what are the reasons (client style or php) it should get fixed as soon as possible.

Comment:
I do agree that the function should disallow those symbols - but only for the reason to keep things consistent with WAR3 game clients. Honstly I don't care at all about possible issues in handlings the clantag in PHP or any other language - one of the most important programming rules you should have learned by now: you should never ever trust user input!
