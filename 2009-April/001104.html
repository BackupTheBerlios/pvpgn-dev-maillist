<PRE>Bug #15482, was updated on 2009-Apr-05 00:47
Here is a current snapshot of the bug.

Project: Player vs Player Gaming Network
Category: Warcraft Series
Status: Open
Resolution: None
Bug Group: bnetd
Priority: 5

Assigned to : none
Summary: /clan create function - allow forbiden chars in clan tag

Details: Hi...
There is a slight problem with the clan create function.
Clan tag should allow only 'A-Z', 'a-z' and '0-9'
and sadly clan create doesn't check it, so clan tags having those chars: !@#$%^&amp;*()-_=+ are created too.
It's a bad thing since it makes problems while trying to read the clan tag from php to view on site.

I don't really care any more If this get fixed or not.
command disabled (for good) on EuroBattle.Net (and I advice to all other server to do this as well)
The idea that 2 users alone can create a clan is bad anyway. It only makes a mass and a lot of dead clans later.

my recommendation to you is to remove this part code from source - the command is bugged anyway.

you can close this bug If you like, doesn't matter for me anyway.

Sorry for being not clear enough - sure the issue should be fixed in PvPGN.
But still I'd consider this a non-critical issue for PvPGN, as it doesn't break anything (but compability). If any external scripts/applications break cause the made assumptions that aren't guaranteed - then whoever made them should fix them, too.

one of the most important programming rules you should have learned by now: you should never ever trust user input!

why are you telling this to me?
I didn't had any connection in creating that command...
anyway... doesn't matter what are the reasons (client style or php) it should get fixed as soon as possible.

Comment:
I do agree that the function should disallow those symbols - but only for the reason to keep things consistent with WAR3 game clients. Honstly I don't care at all about possible issues in handlings the clantag in PHP or any other language - one of the most important programming rules you should have learned by now: you should never ever trust user input!
