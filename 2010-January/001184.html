Summary: got UNKNOWN gamelang for game client ptBR

Details: Hello people, 

I'm using the original Starcraft game version 1.16.1 Brazilian Portuguese (ptBR) as a client.
And as the server pvpgn-1.8.5. The game do not connect and the following error is reported:

[info ] conn_create: [544][484] sessionkey=0x4adb0dc4 sessionnum=0x00000001
[info ] handle_init_packet: [544] client initiated bnet connection
[info ] conn_set_archtag: [544] setting client arch to &quot;IX86&quot;
[info ] conn_set_clienttag: [544] setting client type to &quot;STAR&quot;
[error] conn_set_gamelang: got UNKNOWN gamelang
[info ] conn_destroy: [544] closed bnet connection

Is there any solution to this problem? 
I am grateful for the attention.

Hello pelish
Sorry to be so long without responding, but I found out what the solution by chance. The discovery of the solution was so embarrassing for me to stay all this time without respond to you in shame. But I feel the need to inform, for surely others can go through the same problem. The solution was to grant the privilege local administrator for the Windows computer where the Stracraft game is installed. Again I ask a thousand excuses for not paying any attention to it and for my poor English. Thank you for attention and initiative of all of you PvPGN.

Hello.
At this moment there is not defined ptBR tag so it seems to me as that problem. It is that you bought your game as Brazilian Portuguese language version?  If so - it is possible for you to make some packet dump of that login? The best one will be (for me) created by Wireshark (but the others will be surely compatible). That packet dump please send me by e-mail.

I am really embarrassed by new language of STAR game which is an old one.

Thank you for reporting!
