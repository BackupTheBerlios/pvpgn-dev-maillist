<PRE>Bug #15183, was updated on 2009-Feb-02 15:28
Here is a current snapshot of the bug.

Project: Player vs Player Gaming Network
Category: Warcraft Series
Status: Closed
Resolution: Fixed
Bug Group: bnetd
Priority: 5
Submitted by: u-238
Assigned to : pandaemonium
Summary: Can't join private games

Details: When trying to join a Warcraft III game by typing the game name manually (which is required to enter private games), you get a message saying &quot;require a saved game file&quot; or something similar.

I believe this problem was introduced in SVN revision 520 - after downgrading to revision 519 the problem no longer occurred.

Comment:
This bug was introduced by mine fix (on SVN 520 commit) for bug when loaded games could not be joined. At last we can revert this fix but it will introduce &quot;could not load saved game&quot; bug.

I *think* this scenario is valid:
* view custom games list (public games!)
* select a game to join
* click join (at this point there are no free slots)
* error is 'you can't join game, cannot be found..'
* try again, error is 'you need a save file'
* you will not be able to join the game (even if there are spots) until you refresh the list

Comment:
I currently don't have two WAR3 clients available but you could do a quick test for me to narrow down the cause of this issue:
 - start PvPGN with debug log enabled
 - try to join a private game
 - attach all log lines to this bug that mention startgame4 packet

Thanks alot in advance!

Comment:
I've seen this too (for public games). I was unable to join a game -- despite their being spots open, yet other people could. The error given was 'require a save file..'. Leaving the custom game list, and the re-viewing it fixed the problem for me.
