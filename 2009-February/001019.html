<PRE>Bug #15279, was updated on 2009-Feb-16 23:35
Here is a current snapshot of the bug.

Project: Player vs Player Gaming Network
Category: General
Status: Closed
Resolution: Fixed
Bug Group: bnetd
Priority: 5
Submitted by: saidin
Assigned to : pandaemonium
Summary: clan set motd doesn't escape characters

Details: sql_common#sql_write_clan doesn't do any escaping. One can easily abuse motd to inject any SQL statement. Servers with access above read-only can do some serious harm (e.g. /clan motd '; DROP TABLE BNET; --). While these commands will only be executed much later on, this can still have devastating effects. Here is another example, used to gain full server admin: set motd to &quot;'; update BNET set auth_command_groups=255 where uid = (select uid from BNET where username like 'myacct'; --&quot;. I actually don't think that example will work, put only because motd has a length limit. There already are escape functions used by storage_sql, so maybe just run motd through that?

This kind of bug might be existent in more places, somebody should make a full sweep!

Thanks alot for reporting. The issue is now fixed in both CVS and SVN.

I'm currently evaluating using prepared statements (not yet sure if this can be done with our multiple SQL backends) that would be a better fix for such issues. (But would i.e. for MySQL imply at least version 4.1.2.)
