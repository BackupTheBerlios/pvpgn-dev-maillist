Some kind of assurance that they won't sue us after SC2 gets released and some 
random guy on the net adds sc2 support to pvpgn (as it happened with bnetd).

&gt;<i> The idea of a secure &quot;tunnel&quot; for these cd-key checks makes sense no

</I>
A client proxy would not send the cdkeys to pvpgn. But even if it would send 
them (like right now the clients send the packets directly to pvpgn), the 
protocol makes it impossible for the admin to retrieve them, they are 
encrypted (which kinda makes it hard to proxy but probably not impossible).

&gt;<i> If anything is tracked to that server admin, they will know where to
</I>&gt;<i> look (stolen keys etc.)
</I>
Nobody can steal client keys with pvpgn because they are sent encrypted by the 
client in a way pvpgn can't do nothing about. This is a myth (which started 
because some time ag oblizzard did NOT encrypt the cdkey, not sure if it's 
still valid with older than W3 clients, I assume not but for W3 I know for 
sure it's encrypted and can me read only by Blizzard with their private key 
on their servers).

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Either way, what would happen if the key failed a check ? What good
</I>&gt;<i> is it to PvPGN to check the key (not talking legally now :) )
</I>
Hopefully that would make it clear to Blizzard and the courts that pvpgn does 
not exists to offer an alternative for those that do not have cdkeys but 
actually to offer an alternative for bnet (for example to run a closed 
community LAN party pvpgn server where you cannot use Blizzard's servers).
