Hi d1zzy,

What do you expect to get out of this &quot;after all is said and done&quot; ?

The idea of a secure &quot;tunnel&quot; for these cd-key checks makes sense no
matter how you look at it. The fact that Blizzard didn't go for this
option was their own choice.

With PvPGN attempting to intersect/proxy these requests I think it will
restart Blizzard's hunt to close PvPGN down. I think, if PvPGN is to do
cd-keys, it should be via the secure tunnel, and every admin is giving
a server login.

If anything is tracked to that server admin, they will know where to
look (stolen keys etc.)

Either way, what would happen if the key failed a check ? What good 
is it to PvPGN to check the key (not talking legally now :) )

Cheers

</I>&gt;<i> 0. Background
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One of the major reasons of Blizzard suing bnetd (or at least what they
</I>&gt;<i> stated 
</I>&gt;<i> in court and publicly) was that bnetd was adding value to pirated copies
</I>&gt;<i> thus 
</I>&gt;<i> somehow making people pirate more Blizzard games because of no cd key
</I>&gt;<i> check 
</I>&gt;<i> (which IMO is kinda stupid but anyway, for the sake of the argument).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I remember sometime back in the lawsuit a bnetd dev came with the idea of
</I>&gt;<i> a 
</I>&gt;<i> secure cd-key check relay protocol that would be implemented on bnetd and
</I>
&gt;<i> battle.net servers so that bnetd would use it to check cd-keys against
</I>&gt;<i> b.net 
</I>&gt;<i> servers. Blizzard however did not wanted that (maybe they were lying
</I>about
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> that being the reason to sue bnetd after all?).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Another idea that popped up (more recently) was to have pvpgn proxy the
</I>&gt;<i> cdkey 
</I>&gt;<i> verification to the battle.net server. There is a technical challange if 
</I>&gt;<i> that's even possible (there are some session IDs exchanged that may make
</I>&gt;<i> it 
</I>&gt;<i> technically impossible) but even if it is the major problem with this is
</I>&gt;<i> that 
</I>&gt;<i> all cd-key checks would come from a single IP (the pvpgn one) and
</I>&gt;<i> considering 
</I>&gt;<i> b.net's very agressive cd-key failed check (they ban the IP from which a 
</I>&gt;<i> failed cd-key check was made for a couple of hours) it makes it
</I>impossible
&gt;<i> to 
</I>&gt;<i> really have pvpgn proxy cdkey checks to b.net. Another problem with the 
</I>&gt;<i> server side cdkey proxy is that people can modify the source (it's open 
</I>&gt;<i> source) and disable it easily.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. New idea
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Some guy on the Internet came up with the idea to still proxy cdkey
</I>checks
&gt;<i> but 
</I>&gt;<i> not from pvpgn but from the client somehow. That is, say have on the
</I>&gt;<i> client a 
</I>&gt;<i> launcher/proxy software (closed source, more about that below) that would
</I>
&gt;<i> modify registry settings to localhost (tho that means to modify the
</I>&gt;<i> gameport 
</I>&gt;<i> cause the game also listens on 6112) and a bnet protocol proxy process
</I>&gt;<i> that 
</I>&gt;<i> catchs on the CDKEY packets and proxies them to b.net and if cdkey check 
</I>&gt;<i> fails it will drop the connection and continue to proxy to the original
</I>&gt;<i> pvpgn 
</I>&gt;<i> if it succeeds.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On the server side we could modify it to accept only the proxy or just
</I>&gt;<i> leave 
</I>&gt;<i> it untouched and we advertise the proxy as the only supported connection 
</I>&gt;<i> solution to pvpgn for bnet clients. The fact that other people modify the
</I>
&gt;<i> server to not require the proxy or (in case we don't modify the server)
</I>&gt;<i> use 
</I>&gt;<i> the existent gateway editor should not be our problem.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Sense of purpose
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I wonder if there is any purpose in all this. Blizzard does not seem to
</I>&gt;<i> care 
</I>&gt;<i> about pvpgn anymore tho with sc2 release I believe that will change 
</I>&gt;<i> drastically if pvpgn is to support sc2 but at the same time do we get any
</I>
&gt;<i> legal guarantee they will not threaten us if we implement such a system?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>
