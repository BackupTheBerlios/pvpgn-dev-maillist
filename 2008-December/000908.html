<PRE>Hi there

0. Background

One of the major reasons of Blizzard suing bnetd (or at least what they stated 
in court and publicly) was that bnetd was adding value to pirated copies thus 
somehow making people pirate more Blizzard games because of no cd key check 
(which IMO is kinda stupid but anyway, for the sake of the argument).

I remember sometime back in the lawsuit a bnetd dev came with the idea of a 
secure cd-key check relay protocol that would be implemented on bnetd and 
battle.net servers so that bnetd would use it to check cd-keys against b.net 
servers. Blizzard however did not wanted that (maybe they were lying about 
that being the reason to sue bnetd after all?).

Another idea that popped up (more recently) was to have pvpgn proxy the cdkey 
verification to the battle.net server. There is a technical challange if 
that's even possible (there are some session IDs exchanged that may make it 
technically impossible) but even if it is the major problem with this is that 
all cd-key checks would come from a single IP (the pvpgn one) and considering 
b.net's very agressive cd-key failed check (they ban the IP from which a 
failed cd-key check was made for a couple of hours) it makes it impossible to 
really have pvpgn proxy cdkey checks to b.net. Another problem with the 
server side cdkey proxy is that people can modify the source (it's open 
source) and disable it easily.

1. New idea

Some guy on the Internet came up with the idea to still proxy cdkey checks but 
not from pvpgn but from the client somehow. That is, say have on the client a 
launcher/proxy software (closed source, more about that below) that would 
modify registry settings to localhost (tho that means to modify the gameport 
cause the game also listens on 6112) and a bnet protocol proxy process that 
catchs on the CDKEY packets and proxies them to b.net and if cdkey check 
fails it will drop the connection and continue to proxy to the original pvpgn 
if it succeeds.

On the server side we could modify it to accept only the proxy or just leave 
it untouched and we advertise the proxy as the only supported connection 
solution to pvpgn for bnet clients. The fact that other people modify the 
server to not require the proxy or (in case we don't modify the server) use 
the existent gateway editor should not be our problem.

2. Sense of purpose

I wonder if there is any purpose in all this. Blizzard does not seem to care 
about pvpgn anymore tho with sc2 release I believe that will change 
drastically if pvpgn is to support sc2 but at the same time do we get any 
legal guarantee they will not threaten us if we implement such a system?
