Hi D1zzy,

I forgot about the encryption, but I think the ball is with Blizzard
now. PvPGN (bnetd) did offer to implement something, and Blizzard
rejected it.

I dont think you will ever convince them otherwise, PvPGN is a thron
in the side of Blizzard and will always be one. I don't think it's a
good idea to wiggle the thorn, unless they ask :)

What would the result be of someone emailing/contacting them with a
request to add cd-key checking in ? I think such a &quot;contact&quot; would
have to be carefully worded. They might also have other ideas of how
to do this

Cheers
