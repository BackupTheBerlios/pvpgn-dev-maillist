<PRE>Bug #15327, was updated on 2009-Feb-28 02:25
Here is a current snapshot of the bug.

Project: Player vs Player Gaming Network
Category: None
Status: Open
Resolution: None
Bug Group: bnetd
Priority: 5
Submitted by: jgodbout
Assigned to : pandaemonium
Summary: User Notification Message

Details: When there is a user notification message, such as one of your friends entering the server, joining a game, leaving a game, or leaving a server, the message is sent by the server name, instead of the user triggering the event, which Battle.net does.

For my server, Bored Aussie, this would be an example:
BoredAussie whispers: Your friend m1LkmaN has entered a game called &quot;bvd&quot;.

Where it should be:
m1Lkman whispers: Your friend m1LkmaN has entered a game called &quot;bvd&quot;.

This allows the /r command to go to the user triggering the event.

This can be fixed by changing line 184 of watch.cpp from:

message_send_text(dest_c,message_type_whisper,NULL,msg);

to

message_send_text(dest_c,message_type_whisper,my_c,msg);

I have tested this and it works great.


Thanks,
Jacob Godbout

As you might be well aware open-source projects aren't a democracy but a dictatorship... ;-) So if I vote for making it configurable it will be configurable - but I'll set your preferred choice as the default. ;-)

Yeh it doesn't really need the option.

Doesn't remove any functionality, the only thing it changes is that you can /r to the person. 

I don't see any reason why anyone would want it so the server name whisper them instead of the user.

Comment:
The default should be to have it come from the user, as this is what Battle.net does.

It is also a very often-requested feature on our server.

Comment:
As this seems to be an often requested feature we should consider making it configurable - but I'm not yet sure what default we'd set.

Comment:
Lots of people have been wanting this changed and, since Battle.NET does it, it would improve emulation consistency.
