Sure, that's why we have this mailing list.

In order to traverse the game list maintained by the game.cpp code you
will need to make a function of your own, that will receive a t_game
pointer and some &quot;void*&quot; field that you manage yourself.

So, say you want in some function to traverse the list of games and
print it to screen. So we create a function called print_game like
this (this function is called a callback function):

int print_game(t_game* game, void* /* ignored */)
{
  printf(&quot;Game: %s\n&quot;, game_get_name(game));
  return 0;
}


In order to have this function actually be called for each game we
need to game gamelist_traverse with it as a parameter, like this:
gamelist_traverse(&amp;print_game, 0);

Now, gamelist_traverse will traverse over each t_game structure from
the game list and will call our callback print_game function giving it
as a first parameter the t_game structure and as a second parameter
the second parameter given to gamelist_traverse (in our example &quot;0&quot;
which is ignored).

If you understood so far let's move to a more complex (but more
common) example (where we will use the second parameter too).

Say you are handling a packet received on a &quot;t_connection* con&quot; and
you want for each game of a type to send something over the connection
(over &quot;con&quot;). Notice that we need somehow to pass the &quot;con&quot; from the
caller of gamelist_traverse to our function that handles each t_game.
We use the second parameter &quot;void*&quot; for that.

int append_game_info(t_game* game, void* vcon)
{

  // first convert vcon which is of void* to t_connection* because we
know it's just that
  t_connection* con = static_cast&lt;t_connection*&gt;(vcon);

  if (game_get_type(game) == someType) {
    // append data to &quot;con&quot;
  }

  return 0;
}


And to call gamelist_traverse for that function just do:
gamelist_traverse(&amp;append_game_info, con);
// where &quot;con&quot; here is the t_connection variable that I pass to the callback

I hope this is clear too. In case you need to pass to the function
called on each t_game more data than a single pointer (above we passed
only a t_connection* but in practice you may need to pass more than a
pointer) just make a &quot;struct&quot; that packs all the information that need
to be passed and provide a pointer to it when you call

Example, suppose that I need to pass 2 integers and one pointer (one
integer is used to count the selected games, one to count the total
and the pointer is the t_connection* where we send the data). Then we
have this:

struct append_game_info_cbdata {
  int total, selected;
  t_connection* con;
};

int append_game_info2(t_game* game, void* vdata)
{
  // just like before convert the void* to our actual structure
because we know it's that
  append_game_info_cbdata* data = static_cast&lt;append_game_info_cbdata*&gt;(vdata);

  if (game_get_type(game) == someType) {
     data-&gt;selected++;
     // do stuff on data-&gt;con
  }

  data-&gt;total++;

  return 0;
}

And to call it just use:

append_game_info_cbdata data;
data.total = data.selected = 0;
data.con = con; // where &quot;con&quot; is our local t_connection* that we pass
back to the callback

gamelist_traverse(&amp;append_game_info2, &amp;data);

&gt;<i> Btw I have used &quot;pvpgn-dev mailinglist&quot; now ;)

Good :)
