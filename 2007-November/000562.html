You just need to have handle_kick_command that is right now a &quot;static&quot; in 
command.cpp as an &quot;external&quot;, declared in command.h and that you can call 
from any code, wouldn't that work?

&gt;<i> 2) BAN command doing in bnetd KICK and than BAN (add person to banlist). In
</I>&gt;<i> IRC/WOL are this commands diferent.
</I>
Yes but I don't think I agree making it as IRC. There is a difference between 
emulating a protocol as the network data send/received and emulating it's 
behaviour. We emulate IRC in order to have IRC clients connect and chat to 
pvpgn but we don't emulate IRC behaviour. It's ok to try to make the protocol 
as close as possible to the standard IRC protocol network wise so we can have 
as many as possible IRC clients connect to pvpgn but it's not OK to have the 
behaviour as close as possible to a normal IRC server. That is because we are 
not a normal IRC server and some things are different. For one, I remember 
alot of people asking that /ban should also /kick (some time ago). And I 
don't see why it should be different on IRC/WOL than on battle.net. Plus then 
you get into things like:

- what if a battle.net user issues /ban on a IRC/WOL client? do we follow 
battle.net behaviour (because the operator is battle.net user and expects 
battle.net behaviour) or do we follow IRC/WOL behaviour because the 
target/victim is IRC/WOL and we want to have &quot;pure&quot; IRC/WOL behaviour?

- then the reverse, what if a WOL client /bans a battle.net user? what happens 
then?

In WOL when you issue /ban they don't get kicked? Would it be wrong to also 
kick them? (it makes sense, when you ban users you want them out of the 
channel too so it shouldn't hurt if we make common behaviour as this for all 
protocols)

&gt;<i> 3) in future we can make all other commands (means like normal chat
</I>&gt;<i> commands) in this common file. I think that than will be much more bether
</I>&gt;<i> gaming protocol API
</I>
This I dont really understand. Maybe you need to be more clear what you mean 
by &quot;normal chat commands&quot;.
