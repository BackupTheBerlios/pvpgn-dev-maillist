<PRE>Bug #12173, was updated on 2007-Oct-15 10:44
Here is a current snapshot of the bug.

Project: Player vs Player Gaming Network
Category: Warcraft Series
Status: Closed
Resolution: Invalid
Bug Group: bnetd
Priority: 5
Submitted by: megablue
Assigned to : none
Summary: Game with same name is merged (It didn't get fixed)

Details: I somehow remember there was a report about the same bug. It didn't get fixed, although d1zzy did changed something. I still manage to create a game with exactly the same name with other game host.

Comment:
I'm think of pvpgn the doesn't send the correct packet to deny the create game request. the host is still able to enter the game despite of the case of the game name (well... there are both same client).

Comment:
If you try to create a game with same case insensitive name as another, for the same clienttag (notice that War3 and War3TFT are different so you can have 2 games with same but one for War3 and other for TFT) you should get an error. Otherwise it should work.
