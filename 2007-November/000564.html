<PRE>There are many things that we need to sovle arround KICK and BAN commands.
When I will
change &quot;static&quot; to &quot;external&quot; than It will be the same like before.
That is because there is
&quot;skip command&quot; &quot;get dst&quot;... My idea was in moving core of all commands
to another file and
here (in command.cpp) only solve problems arround tokenization &quot;char * text&quot;
commands (I mean &quot;skip command, get dst etc&quot;). About fact when is KICK
included in BAN: I dont want to change that. I only want to make it much
more common - also when we will have all functions in some common file than
we can have once KICK things and use it subsequently: when will be called
from BNET like now, when will be called from IRC/WOL only BANing.

there is an exemple for KICK command in command_common.cpp:
extern _handle_kick_command (t_connection * sender, t_connection * kicked,
char * reason)
{
 /* some kick code */
}

there is an exemple for BAN command in command_common.cpp:
extern _handle_ban_command (t_connection * sender, t_connection * banned,
char * reason)
{
 /* some ban code without KICK */
}

and here is command.cpp (used for commands from client by &quot;/[command]
KICK:
static int _handle_kick_command(t_connection * c, char const *text)
{
/* skip command */
/* get dst*/
_handle_kick_command (c,dst,text);
}

BAN:
static int _handle_ban_command(t_connection * c, char const *text)
{
/* skip command */
/* get dst*/
_handle_kick_command (c,dst,text);
_handle_ban_command (c,dst,text);
}

There is also another problem that I havent mentioned here.
when I kick someone in IRC/WOL i must send special message that
include my nick, nick of kicked person and reason. This message is
sended to all connection in channel.
The problem is in fact that I cant formate it by message_type
formating since there is only
my connection,
*text, and dst connection. Dst connection is changing for all ppl in channel.

The last thing that I have on my mind is that we need to have many
message_type_error formating that only once.
It is because in IRC/WOL are error codes for many situations but I must
check it explicitely before I calling original function that do the same
checking but sends only message_type_error. This is not so common at the
moment too.

Hope that You will understand me my friends ;)
