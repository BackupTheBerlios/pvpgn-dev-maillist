Here is a current snapshot of the bug.

Status: Open
Resolution: None
Bug Group: bnetd
Priority: 5

Summary: Clan leaders are not channel ops in their clan channel

Details: Chieftains and Shamans should have operator priveleges for their clan channels.

This does not appear to work however.

Comment:
On official servers, all members in a WAR3/W3XP clan with the rank Cheiftain or Shaman are given OPs in their clan channel automatically.  When I say Ops, I mean the yellow bar around their name with the &quot;hammer&quot; privileges (the ability to kick and ban players from the clan channel).

Note that the only way to do this now is give the person /tmpop and hope they don't disconnect.  /op and /aop and /admin do not work very well for this purpose, as most clans will use a bot for moderating the channel.  If the bot doesn't see itself with having the gold bar / hammer icon it won't try to use /kick or /ban.  /aop /admin and /op users do not get the yellow bar around their name.  /tmpop users do, however with clans this doesn't work too well because an admin has to give /tmpop to the cheiftain and shamans every time they join the channel (since its /tmpop they lose the yellow bar / hammer icon when they leave and don't get it when they come back.  In the official server all shamans and the cheiftain automatically get the hammer / yellow bar when they join their clan channel.)

Comment:
How it is on official battle.net servers? We should mimic them in this scope.
