<PRE>I think that could be solved by adding a code to validate a previous existing &quot;short&quot; name in the database and or adding the primary key also on short column... here Im not sure if this will impact in some way how PVPGN works. Since I have not any development skills I cant solve the problem by my own but If I cant give you guys any help to solve this just let me know.

Also, here is the commit info for when clanlist_find_clan_by_clantag was changed to case insensitive by d1zzy way back in 2006 (SVN 230):

commit c32b608644b5509cf9b7b72befae93a9476c0e20
Author: d1zzy &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/pvpgn-dev">d1zzy at f47984b3-f1e4-0310-9569-ebefd53020b6</A>&gt;
Date:   Mon Jun 26 21:27:01 2006 +0000

    Changed clan code to use a specific type for tags (t_clantag typedefed
    to t_tag), change the check for finding existent clans by tag to be case
    insensitive (so that people cant create clans with same tag but
    different case which broke some stuff in channels, closes bug#6314).

I haven't found time to test this myself as you need 9 people to in the same channel and whatnot. However, I have had a brief look through the code:

A packet of type CLIENT_CLAN_CREATEREQ triggers a call to handle_bnet#_client_clan_createreq. After doing a sanity check, this method then calls clan#clan_get_possible_member (very badly named).

clan#clan_get_possible_member does a call to clan#clanlist_find_clan_by_clantag. This method returns a pointer to the clan if it is found. The search is done using strcasecmp (doesn't care about case). If the search returns a clan, then a SERVER_CLAN_CREATEREPLY_CHECK_ALLREADY_IN_USE packet is sent.

I didn't think there would be anything to gain looking further. As far as I can see, the check (to see if a clan with that tag exists) is fine. But that doesn't make sense! Even if the packet reply was wrong, I don't see how bnetd can possibly create the clan.

I can confirm this issue to be existant without testing it or taking any closer look at the code. 
At least in a weaker form I'm well aware of the issue since a very long time: You can register clans with same same clantag but different casing of the letters. &quot;CLAN&quot;, &quot;CLAn&quot;, &quot;CLan&quot;, &quot;Clan&quot;, ...

I'm not sure if there is a quick fix for this issue, it's more like a fundamental flaw in the code design. I'm working on rewriting clan handling from scratch on SVN - but this will take a few more weeks until it reaches a usable state.

Just adding constraints in the DB won't get the issue fixed - it will just cause even more problems due to data inconsistency. 

So there are currently two options:
 - provide a patch to fix this issue on 1.8.x branch
 - wait for me to fix the issue in dev branch

Thats right, but I didnt want to make any change to the DB schema, because I cannot assure that there will not cause any odd issue due to the &quot;unique&quot; condition (not managed by the PVPGN code).
By the way would be great if you can also take a look and reproduce the issue, so I have another mate that also is reproducing this ;)

Ensure that you are using the sql_DB_layout since I didnt check if this also happen using the sql_DB_layout2

I'm dumbfounded that such an error hasn't been picked up before - so I'm a little skeptical. I will do my own testing :)

This has nothing to do with SQL by the way - simply adding a UNIQUE on the clan short will block the creation in the database, but still create the clan in-memory (therefore it will exist until server shutdown).

Comment:
No, this issue happens using the in-game clan registration. So if a group of users (10) are creating the clan, they can use the same &quot;short name&quot;, but use a different &quot;name&quot;. In the DB this looks fine since the &quot;cid&quot; is different for the 2 clan, but for the original clan is a trouble because the clone clan have the same identifier at the right of the nick of its members and also the same &quot;clan channel&quot;.


Thanks! :)

Comment:
Does this only happen with the /clan command? Or does it happen with in-game clan creation? If it's only the command, then it's probably just an oversight.

I almost forgot it. Im currently using PVPGN 1.8.4 on Linux (Ubuntu) and MySQL 5

Thanks guys for all your hard work on this great Project :)
