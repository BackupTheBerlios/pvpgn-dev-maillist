<PRE>I think that could be solved by adding a code to validate a previous existing &quot;short&quot; name in the database and or adding the primary key also on short column... here Im not sure if this will impact in some way how PVPGN works. Since I have not any development skills I cant solve the problem by my own but If I cant give you guys any help to solve this just let me know.

@gammafan,

Yes, the clantag is stored as an integer. However, the code in clan#clanlist_find_clan_by_clantag converts back to a string and then does a caseless comparison. This is what d1zzy changed in 2006, which is what I stated in my first response.

Also, just to reiterate, the database schema has nothing to do with this issue. The integrity must be maintained application-side; otherwise the clan will exist in-memory and the unique check will only be enforced when the storage layer is flushed.

Hi,

Thanks for looking into this =)

As far as I can understand the &quot;schema&quot; of the 2 DB layout are almost the same (at least regarding clan table and members), as you pointed at the code looks fine (on SVN branch) but looking at the clan.c from the 1.8.5, I found this piece of code:

extern int str_to_clantag(const char *str)
{
    int clantag = 0;

    if (!str)
	return 0;

    if (str[0])
    {
	clantag = str[0] &lt;&lt; 24;
	if (str[1])
	{
	    clantag += str[1] &lt;&lt; 16;
	    if (str[2])
	    {
		clantag += str[2] &lt;&lt; 8;
		if (str[3])
		    clantag += str[3];
	    }
	}
    }
    return clantag;

}

I have very pathetic dev skills so from now are just guessing. From my reading of that I understand that there is a conversion from the numeric value stored in the database related to the short name (clantag) to character. Here what it means (if my guessing are correct) if there is a numeric value assigned to a clantag... this value will be different according to the case used so as pandaemonium pointed this is correct since is allowing the creation of a clan using different case since the numeric value store is different as the cases are. T
his conversion is at runtime level and is not related to the value in the database because this is numeric not character, and then when the code compares the creation clantag and against an existant, this is different because the case used are different.

Maybe all of this is stupid and Im just talking non senses words, but that is my understanding.


Thanks!

I delegated testing to one of my admins. He claims to have tried with a couple of combinations (using both in-game and command versions of clan creation) and neither allowed him to create the clan. Furthermore, the error received is correct ('clan tag already being used..'). 

I know you're on 1.8.4 (from topic you linked). The case-agnostic clantag search was added in 2006, and 1.8.4 was released in 2008. I don't see how/why your server is behaving in such a way. I can only confirm that it behaves properly in SVN trunk.

As far as I'm concerned though, the code certainly looks good, and seems to behave properly. Maybe try update your software? I am unable to get near a W3XP client for testing in the near future, but if you still have the problem with the latest code, I guess I can take another look.

Hi saidin,

thanks alot for looking into the issue. I propably won't have the time to look into it this week - but I can give you a hint:
You just need 1 WAR3/W3XP clients and 9 bnchat-bots (in WAR3 mode).
(bnchat --client=WAR3 or bnchat --client=W3XP). The bnchat client in SVN is able to handle clan-create-invote packets and lets you reply with a propper accept packet.

Also, here is the commit info for when clanlist_find_clan_by_clantag was changed to case insensitive by d1zzy way back in 2006 (SVN 230):

commit c32b608644b5509cf9b7b72befae93a9476c0e20
Author: d1zzy &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/pvpgn-dev">d1zzy at f47984b3-f1e4-0310-9569-ebefd53020b6</A>&gt;
Date:   Mon Jun 26 21:27:01 2006 +0000

    Changed clan code to use a specific type for tags (t_clantag typedefed
    to t_tag), change the check for finding existent clans by tag to be case
    insensitive (so that people cant create clans with same tag but
    different case which broke some stuff in channels, closes bug#6314).

I haven't found time to test this myself as you need 9 people to in the same channel and whatnot. However, I have had a brief look through the code:

A packet of type CLIENT_CLAN_CREATEREQ triggers a call to handle_bnet#_client_clan_createreq. After doing a sanity check, this method then calls clan#clan_get_possible_member (very badly named).

clan#clan_get_possible_member does a call to clan#clanlist_find_clan_by_clantag. This method returns a pointer to the clan if it is found. The search is done using strcasecmp (doesn't care about case). If the search returns a clan, then a SERVER_CLAN_CREATEREPLY_CHECK_ALLREADY_IN_USE packet is sent.

I didn't think there would be anything to gain looking further. As far as I can see, the check (to see if a clan with that tag exists) is fine. But that doesn't make sense! Even if the packet reply was wrong, I don't see how bnetd can possibly create the clan.

I can confirm this issue to be existant without testing it or taking any closer look at the code. 
At least in a weaker form I'm well aware of the issue since a very long time: You can register clans with same same clantag but different casing of the letters. &quot;CLAN&quot;, &quot;CLAn&quot;, &quot;CLan&quot;, &quot;Clan&quot;, ...

I'm not sure if there is a quick fix for this issue, it's more like a fundamental flaw in the code design. I'm working on rewriting clan handling from scratch on SVN - but this will take a few more weeks until it reaches a usable state.

Just adding constraints in the DB won't get the issue fixed - it will just cause even more problems due to data inconsistency. 

So there are currently two options:
 - provide a patch to fix this issue on 1.8.x branch
 - wait for me to fix the issue in dev branch

Thats right, but I didnt want to make any change to the DB schema, because I cannot assure that there will not cause any odd issue due to the &quot;unique&quot; condition (not managed by the PVPGN code).
By the way would be great if you can also take a look and reproduce the issue, so I have another mate that also is reproducing this ;)

Ensure that you are using the sql_DB_layout since I didnt check if this also happen using the sql_DB_layout2

I'm dumbfounded that such an error hasn't been picked up before - so I'm a little skeptical. I will do my own testing :)

This has nothing to do with SQL by the way - simply adding a UNIQUE on the clan short will block the creation in the database, but still create the clan in-memory (therefore it will exist until server shutdown).

Comment:
No, this issue happens using the in-game clan registration. So if a group of users (10) are creating the clan, they can use the same &quot;short name&quot;, but use a different &quot;name&quot;. In the DB this looks fine since the &quot;cid&quot; is different for the 2 clan, but for the original clan is a trouble because the clone clan have the same identifier at the right of the nick of its members and also the same &quot;clan channel&quot;.


Thanks! :)

Does this only happen with the /clan command? Or does it happen with in-game clan creation? If it's only the command, then it's probably just an oversight.

I almost forgot it. Im currently using PVPGN 1.8.4 on Linux (Ubuntu) and MySQL 5

Thanks guys for all your hard work on this great Project :)
