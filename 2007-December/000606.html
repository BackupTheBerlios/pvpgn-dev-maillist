Sure, but not doing it because of that is like not using any license of your 
code and use public domain assuming nobody gives a shit about any copyright 
and lincese.

&gt;<i> I think we can relicense some really important core parts of PvPGN to

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>
Yes, sorry to not have specified, I ment 1.99.x strictly (ofc, future 
revisions, people can take and do whatever &quot;GPLv2 and later&quot; allows them with 
the current code).

&gt;<i> But there is one thing I don't know and don't really understand:
</I>&gt;<i>    what license is an unified diff to code written under (A)GPLv3 under?
</I>
Should be exactly under the license that the code author released that code 
with. It does not matter under which form the code is presented (unified diff 
or directly patched in files) what it matters is that it is code copyrighted 
by some author and that the author wants to release it with some specific 
license. The users cannot take AGPLv3 code and combine it with &quot;GPLv2 or 
later&quot; code without being bound to both &quot;GPLv2 or later&quot; and AGPLv3 (that is 
actually what we will do, we will convert our own written code to AGPLv3, 
redistribute &quot;GPLv2 or later&quot; under GPLv3 and the whole combination will be 
bound by both AGPLv3 and GPLv3).

&gt;<i> The reason I'm asking this is simple: could people simply rip off any
</I>&gt;<i> future changes under the new license by simply applying the same patches
</I>&gt;<i> to a GPLv2 codebase?
</I>
As I exaplained I don't think they can do that. What they can do is to remove 
AGPLv3 code from code base and implement thair own (possibly reusing 
old &quot;GPLv2 or later&quot; code for that) or just fork/use the latest &quot;GPLv2 or 
later&quot; codebase.

So from your perspective, doing this license change wouldn't make you 
contribute less code to pvpgn and you don't see any other problems with it 
that might affect pvpgn? (this question is valid for the other people on this 
list too, especially people who contributed code back to pvpgn I am 
interested of hearing their oppinion on this)
