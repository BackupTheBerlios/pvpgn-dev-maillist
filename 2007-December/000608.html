In this specific case you could provide full sources to your own pvpgn 
modifications (thus to the server part to support your game) and implement 
from 0 your own client side network code (which you had to do anyway because 
pvpgn does not have almost any client code). Why would you need to keep 
closed source the server part?

PvPGN is already &quot;GPLv2 or later&quot;, there is no &quot;turning back&quot; to BSD license 
possible. Also, GPL licenses (those which force you to give back code) are 
not very attractive as you said for businesses to use (ie to use existent 
pvpgn code) but they are atractive to businesses when they want to release 
their own proprietary code to open source (since then they at least that any 
other competitive business has to provide sources to it if it will use their 
released code). So even with businesses and using GPL it depends...
