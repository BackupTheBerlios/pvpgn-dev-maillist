Ok, then you could take another aproach. Have your content stuff in a separate 
server that talks with pvpgn a network protocol (just like d2gs does with 
d2cs and like you can see d2cs is GPL while d2gs is not nor does it needs to 
be). I think that won't change with AGPL since for all users communicating 
with pvpgn you can offer them your (modified) pvpgn source but you do not 
need to offer them your &quot;game server&quot; source because that one is not covered 
by AGPL nor does it needs to be (AGPL just as GPL does not &quot;infect&quot; programs 
that communicate with AGPL/GPL programs through network protocols and such).
