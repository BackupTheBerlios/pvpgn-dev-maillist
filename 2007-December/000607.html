<PRE>I am going to try and keep this short as possible. First off I think 
Dizzy, Aaron, and Pelish should listen to your own opinions a lot more 
strongly(bad grammar?) than anyone else on the list. Second im only 
posting here because dizzy really wanted me to post.

The goal is to get more code back into pvpgn. I only see 2 options
1) Use a license that FORCES people to give back there code legaly (GPL, 
agpl3, whatever)
Pros:
*Legally  requires someone to give back there mods.
Cons:
*It costs a lot of money to sue someone breaking the law. And if you do 
sue someone, most of the server admins do not have any money to &quot;win&quot; 
anyways. (right now the only servers i see using mods are eurobattle and 
some korean servers)
*It locks out business from using pvpgn. A business can not really put 
there new game into the pvpgn framework if they are required to give all 
there changes back. Maybe the business does not want to do that.
*The chances of someone giving there changes back even if its legally 
required is rare. I mean look at how many people download mp3's and 
stuff and thats &quot;legally wrong&quot;
*Its not really open source software IMHO because it forces people to do 
things. Pretty much the same as closed source software, forcing people 
to do things.


2) Use a license that makes it free, and hope people &quot;do the right 
thing&quot; (BSD)
Pros:
*Business's can still use pvpgn
*Its still free open source software IMHO.
Cons:
*its not legally required to give back changes. You have to count on 
people &quot;doing the right thing&quot;
*The chances of a business using pvpgn is low. The chances of a business 
giving back changes could be just as low as option 1


I guess in my personal opinion it comes down to i think the chances of 
code making there way back in pvpgn are slighly higher from a business 
than from legally scaring some server admins that probley do not speak 
english and will never even read the license. (and have no money to sue, 
and we have no money to sue)

I hate to put everything on my own shoulders but i will say i honestly 
have some plans to use pvpgn for my own game, (like planned on hopefully 
soon, within 6 months) and i would like nothing more than to built a 
video game on top of pvpgn, and keep my game server code closed, but 
still give back changes to pvpgn and bug fixes. This happens ALL the 
time btw in the BSD community. Companys base there products on Freebsd 
for example and when they find bugs and stuff they give back patches, 
&quot;just because&quot;.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyways Aaron: Really interesting point of view... I hope that they

</I>&gt;<i>     Hi d1zzy,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I like the idea alot! Even though I'm quite sure we won't recieve a
</I>&gt;<i>     single line of extra code from the &quot;thieves&quot;. I doubt any of us
</I>&gt;<i>     developers would feel like really suing a random server admin -
</I>&gt;<i>     even one
</I>&gt;<i>     that added some really cool killer features (tm). The reason is
</I>&gt;<i>     simply:
</I>&gt;<i>     the chances are 99.9% they live in a country that gives a fuck about
</I>&gt;<i>     copyrights and contracts anyways-  so even trying it won't even be
</I>&gt;<i>     worth
</I>&gt;<i>     the fees for a lawyer.
</I>&gt;<i>     I think we can relicense some really important core parts of PvPGN to
</I>&gt;<i>     AGPLv3 - like the storage, network and config backend. Same should be
</I>&gt;<i>     true for most parts of ladder code and a majority of the IRC/WOL
</I>&gt;<i>     code.
</I>&gt;<i>     It might even be a good reason to continue some C++ porting work - as
</I>&gt;<i>     the rewritten code can be under a new license. (A core component like
</I>&gt;<i>     connection or account would be a real cool thing to have under
</I>&gt;<i>     AGPLv3.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I think the 1.8.x codebase isn't that easy to handle as too much stuff
</I>&gt;<i>     still has its origins back in bnetd. But even for that code GPLv3
</I>&gt;<i>     would
</I>&gt;<i>     at least be a good start.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     But there is one thing I don't know and don't really understand:
</I>&gt;<i>        what license is an unified diff to code written under (A)GPLv3
</I>&gt;<i>     under?
</I>&gt;<i>     The reason I'm asking this is simple: could people simply rip off any
</I>&gt;<i>     future changes under the new license by simply applying the same
</I>&gt;<i>     patches
</I>&gt;<i>     to a GPLv2 codebase?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Best regards
</I>&gt;<i>        Aaron

</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; Hi
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; Lately I have noticed there is alot of servers out there that
</I>&gt;<i>     perform
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; customizations on the PvPGN source code and do not give us any
</I>&gt;<i>     patches or do
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; not provide the source. This is (according to GPLv2, the current
</I>&gt;<i>     PvPGN
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; license) absolutely legal (tho not very much in the spirit of
</I>&gt;<i>     the license).
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; The FSF (which makes these licenses) also made a licensed called
</I>&gt;<i>     Affero GPL
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; (AGPL) which is now at version 3. It is the same identical text
</I>&gt;<i>     as GPLv3 with
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; the addition that you do need to distribute source code to your
</I>&gt;<i>     network users
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; (just as with GPL you needed to do that to the people you
</I>&gt;<i>     distributed binary
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; code). So I was thinking maybe we should switch PvPGN license
</I>&gt;<i>     from &quot;GPLv2 and
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; later&quot; to AGPLv3 (and GPLv3, see bellow).
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; We cannot change it completely to AGPLv3 because it is
</I>&gt;<i>     impossible to contact
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; and get agreement to switch to AGPLv3 for every person who
</I>&gt;<i>     contributed enough
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; code in PvPGN to be protected by copyright (think about all
</I>&gt;<i>     those old bnetd
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; contributers). But, from what I have discussed with fsf.org
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;<A HREF="http://fsf.org">http://fsf.org</A>&gt; people, we can
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; change all the code we have written (or for which we get
</I>&gt;<i>     permission from the
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; author) to AGPLv3 and we can distribute this along with the code
</I>&gt;<i>     we cannot
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; change, because that code is still under &quot;GPLv2 or later&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i>     meaning it can be
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; distributed under GPLv3 and GPLv3 is compatible with AGPLv3 (ie
</I>&gt;<i>     you can
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; combine code of GPLv3 and AGPLv3 in the same project).
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; If we do this then any person who receives our combined
</I>&gt;<i>     GPLv3/AGPLv3 code has
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; to obey both licenses (because it contains code both with GPLv3
</I>&gt;<i>     and with
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; AGPLv3). Which means that they will have to provide source code
</I>&gt;<i>     of their
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; modifications to pvpgn (they can avoid this if they remove every
</I>&gt;<i>     AGPL code
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; part from the project, possibly reimplementing those features
</I>&gt;<i>     themselves but
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; this is very unlikely because if we change to AGPLv3 at least
</I>&gt;<i>     the code that
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; aaron, Pelish and I have written then it is enough of code to
</I>&gt;<i>     make it very
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; hard to remove it and rewrite it to avoid AGPL constraints).
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; Of course, there is also the issue that they can just ignore the
</I>&gt;<i>     license
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; alltogether and act illegal about it, that is their choice but
</I>&gt;<i>     then they risk
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; to be made fun of, appear in slashdot.org &lt;<A HREF="http://slashdot.org">http://slashdot.org</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     or even be sued by FSF lawyers :)
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; What do you think? (I would expect people who perform
</I>&gt;<i>     modifications and do not
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; release to oppose this but I really do not care, I am interested
</I>&gt;<i>     about
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; reasons against doing this that would hurt pvpgn and the
</I>&gt;<i>     development process,
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; not reasons that hurt whatever random people who &quot;steal&quot; the
</I>&gt;<i>     code and don't
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; give anything back)
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;
