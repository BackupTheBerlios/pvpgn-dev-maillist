<PRE>Hi d1zzy,

I like the idea alot! Even though I'm quite sure we won't recieve a 
single line of extra code from the &quot;thieves&quot;. I doubt any of us 
developers would feel like really suing a random server admin - even one 
that added some really cool killer features (tm). The reason is simply: 
the chances are 99.9% they live in a country that gives a fuck about 
copyrights and contracts anyways-  so even trying it won't even be worth 
the fees for a lawyer.
I think we can relicense some really important core parts of PvPGN to 
AGPLv3 - like the storage, network and config backend. Same should be 
true for most parts of ladder code and a majority of the IRC/WOL code.
It might even be a good reason to continue some C++ porting work - as 
the rewritten code can be under a new license. (A core component like 
connection or account would be a real cool thing to have under AGPLv3.)

I think the 1.8.x codebase isn't that easy to handle as too much stuff 
still has its origins back in bnetd. But even for that code GPLv3 would 
at least be a good start.

But there is one thing I don't know and don't really understand:
   what license is an unified diff to code written under (A)GPLv3 under?
The reason I'm asking this is simple: could people simply rip off any 
future changes under the new license by simply applying the same patches 
to a GPLv2 codebase?

Best regards
   Aaron

&gt;<i> Hi
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Lately I have noticed there is alot of servers out there that perform 
</I>&gt;<i> customizations on the PvPGN source code and do not give us any patches or do 
</I>&gt;<i> not provide the source. This is (according to GPLv2, the current PvPGN 
</I>&gt;<i> license) absolutely legal (tho not very much in the spirit of the license). 
</I>&gt;<i> The FSF (which makes these licenses) also made a licensed called Affero GPL 
</I>&gt;<i> (AGPL) which is now at version 3. It is the same identical text as GPLv3 with 
</I>&gt;<i> the addition that you do need to distribute source code to your network users 
</I>&gt;<i> (just as with GPL you needed to do that to the people you distributed binary 
</I>&gt;<i> code). So I was thinking maybe we should switch PvPGN license from &quot;GPLv2 and 
</I>&gt;<i> later&quot; to AGPLv3 (and GPLv3, see bellow).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We cannot change it completely to AGPLv3 because it is impossible to contact 
</I>&gt;<i> and get agreement to switch to AGPLv3 for every person who contributed enough 
</I>&gt;<i> code in PvPGN to be protected by copyright (think about all those old bnetd 
</I>&gt;<i> contributers). But, from what I have discussed with fsf.org people, we can 
</I>&gt;<i> change all the code we have written (or for which we get permission from the 
</I>&gt;<i> author) to AGPLv3 and we can distribute this along with the code we cannot 
</I>&gt;<i> change, because that code is still under &quot;GPLv2 or later&quot;, meaning it can be 
</I>&gt;<i> distributed under GPLv3 and GPLv3 is compatible with AGPLv3 (ie you can 
</I>&gt;<i> combine code of GPLv3 and AGPLv3 in the same project).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If we do this then any person who receives our combined GPLv3/AGPLv3 code has 
</I>&gt;<i> to obey both licenses (because it contains code both with GPLv3 and with 
</I>&gt;<i> AGPLv3). Which means that they will have to provide source code of their 
</I>&gt;<i> modifications to pvpgn (they can avoid this if they remove every AGPL code 
</I>&gt;<i> part from the project, possibly reimplementing those features themselves but 
</I>&gt;<i> this is very unlikely because if we change to AGPLv3 at least the code that 
</I>&gt;<i> aaron, Pelish and I have written then it is enough of code to make it very 
</I>&gt;<i> hard to remove it and rewrite it to avoid AGPL constraints).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, there is also the issue that they can just ignore the license 
</I>&gt;<i> alltogether and act illegal about it, that is their choice but then they risk 
</I>&gt;<i> to be made fun of, appear in slashdot.org or even be sued by FSF lawyers :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What do you think? (I would expect people who perform modifications and do not 
</I>&gt;<i> release to oppose this but I really do not care, I am interested about 
</I>&gt;<i> reasons against doing this that would hurt pvpgn and the development process, 
</I>&gt;<i> not reasons that hurt whatever random people who &quot;steal&quot; the code and don't 
</I>&gt;<i> give anything back)
</I>&gt;<i>
