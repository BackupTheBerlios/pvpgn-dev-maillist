<PRE>Hi Arron, hi d1zzy,
I vote for changing GPLv2 to &quot;GPLv3/AGPLv3&quot;. All yours ideas for do that
seems for me reasonable. I hope that we can contact many of contributors and
than we
can have most of &quot;old&quot; work under this new licence too. It is a few
days when I have contacted Gatekeep so I think that we can have all
WOL stuff under AGPLv3.
When we will rewrite most of to C++ we can also have most of code under this
licence.

Anyways Aaron: Really interesting point of view... I hope that they can not
do simple backporting changes under GPLv2 but I dont know that.

Pelish

</I>&gt;<i> Hi d1zzy,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I like the idea alot! Even though I'm quite sure we won't recieve a
</I>&gt;<i> single line of extra code from the &quot;thieves&quot;. I doubt any of us
</I>&gt;<i> developers would feel like really suing a random server admin - even one
</I>&gt;<i> that added some really cool killer features (tm). The reason is simply:
</I>&gt;<i> the chances are 99.9% they live in a country that gives a fuck about
</I>&gt;<i> copyrights and contracts anyways-  so even trying it won't even be worth
</I>&gt;<i> the fees for a lawyer.
</I>&gt;<i> I think we can relicense some really important core parts of PvPGN to
</I>&gt;<i> AGPLv3 - like the storage, network and config backend. Same should be
</I>&gt;<i> true for most parts of ladder code and a majority of the IRC/WOL code.
</I>&gt;<i> It might even be a good reason to continue some C++ porting work - as
</I>&gt;<i> the rewritten code can be under a new license. (A core component like
</I>&gt;<i> connection or account would be a real cool thing to have under AGPLv3.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think the 1.8.x codebase isn't that easy to handle as too much stuff
</I>&gt;<i> still has its origins back in bnetd. But even for that code GPLv3 would
</I>&gt;<i> at least be a good start.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But there is one thing I don't know and don't really understand:
</I>&gt;<i>    what license is an unified diff to code written under (A)GPLv3 under?
</I>&gt;<i> The reason I'm asking this is simple: could people simply rip off any
</I>&gt;<i> future changes under the new license by simply applying the same patches
</I>&gt;<i> to a GPLv2 codebase?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best regards
</I>&gt;<i>    Aaron

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Lately I have noticed there is alot of servers out there that perform
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; customizations on the PvPGN source code and do not give us any patches
</I>&gt;<i> or do
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not provide the source. This is (according to GPLv2, the current PvPGN
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; license) absolutely legal (tho not very much in the spirit of the
</I>&gt;<i> license).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The FSF (which makes these licenses) also made a licensed called Affero
</I>&gt;<i> GPL
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (AGPL) which is now at version 3. It is the same identical text as GPLv3
</I>&gt;<i> with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the addition that you do need to distribute source code to your network
</I>&gt;<i> users
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (just as with GPL you needed to do that to the people you distributed
</I>&gt;<i> binary
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; code). So I was thinking maybe we should switch PvPGN license from
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;GPLv2 and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; later&quot; to AGPLv3 (and GPLv3, see bellow).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We cannot change it completely to AGPLv3 because it is impossible to
</I>&gt;<i> contact
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and get agreement to switch to AGPLv3 for every person who contributed
</I>&gt;<i> enough
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; code in PvPGN to be protected by copyright (think about all those old
</I>&gt;<i> bnetd
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; contributers). But, from what I have discussed with fsf.org people, we
</I>&gt;<i> can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; change all the code we have written (or for which we get permission from
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; author) to AGPLv3 and we can distribute this along with the code we
</I>&gt;<i> cannot
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; change, because that code is still under &quot;GPLv2 or later&quot;, meaning it
</I>&gt;<i> can be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; distributed under GPLv3 and GPLv3 is compatible with AGPLv3 (ie you can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; combine code of GPLv3 and AGPLv3 in the same project).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If we do this then any person who receives our combined GPLv3/AGPLv3
</I>&gt;<i> code has
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to obey both licenses (because it contains code both with GPLv3 and with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; AGPLv3). Which means that they will have to provide source code of their
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; modifications to pvpgn (they can avoid this if they remove every AGPL
</I>&gt;<i> code
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; part from the project, possibly reimplementing those features themselves
</I>&gt;<i> but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this is very unlikely because if we change to AGPLv3 at least the code
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; aaron, Pelish and I have written then it is enough of code to make it
</I>&gt;<i> very
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hard to remove it and rewrite it to avoid AGPL constraints).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Of course, there is also the issue that they can just ignore the license
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; alltogether and act illegal about it, that is their choice but then they
</I>&gt;<i> risk
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to be made fun of, appear in slashdot.org or even be sued by FSF lawyers
</I>&gt;<i> :)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What do you think? (I would expect people who perform modifications and
</I>&gt;<i> do not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; release to oppose this but I really do not care, I am interested about
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reasons against doing this that would hurt pvpgn and the development
</I>&gt;<i> process,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not reasons that hurt whatever random people who &quot;steal&quot; the code and
</I>&gt;<i> don't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; give anything back)
