</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In this specific case you could provide full sources to your own pvpgn

</I>&gt;<i> from 0 your own client side network code (which you had to do anyway because 
</I>&gt;<i> pvpgn does not have almost any client code). Why would you need to keep 
</I>&gt;<i> closed source the server part?
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Because these days a lot of &quot;game content&quot; is in the server side code. 
100% dynamic events, real world changes like weather, and things like 
that. If you know Final Fantasy 11 (there first final fantasy MMO) there 
is a massive amount of &quot;ecosystem&quot; code that is all server side. 
Countrys trade with each other and effect prices, and weather effects 
your stats and all kinds of weird things like that. Server side content 
can be big and important.

&gt;<i> PvPGN is already &quot;GPLv2 or later&quot;, there is no &quot;turning back&quot; to BSD license 
</I>&gt;<i> possible. Also, GPL licenses (those which force you to give back code) are 
</I>&gt;<i> not very attractive as you said for businesses to use (ie to use existent 
</I>&gt;<i> pvpgn code) but they are atractive to businesses when they want to release 
</I>&gt;<i> their own proprietary code to open source (since then they at least that any 
</I>&gt;<i> other competitive business has to provide sources to it if it will use their 
</I>&gt;<i> released code). So even with businesses and using GPL it depends...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>That is a very intresting point i did not know about.
