<PRE>Hi

Lately I have noticed there is alot of servers out there that perform 
customizations on the PvPGN source code and do not give us any patches or do 
not provide the source. This is (according to GPLv2, the current PvPGN 
license) absolutely legal (tho not very much in the spirit of the license). 
The FSF (which makes these licenses) also made a licensed called Affero GPL 
(AGPL) which is now at version 3. It is the same identical text as GPLv3 with 
the addition that you do need to distribute source code to your network users 
(just as with GPL you needed to do that to the people you distributed binary 
code). So I was thinking maybe we should switch PvPGN license from &quot;GPLv2 and 
later&quot; to AGPLv3 (and GPLv3, see bellow).

We cannot change it completely to AGPLv3 because it is impossible to contact 
and get agreement to switch to AGPLv3 for every person who contributed enough 
code in PvPGN to be protected by copyright (think about all those old bnetd 
contributers). But, from what I have discussed with fsf.org people, we can 
change all the code we have written (or for which we get permission from the 
author) to AGPLv3 and we can distribute this along with the code we cannot 
change, because that code is still under &quot;GPLv2 or later&quot;, meaning it can be 
distributed under GPLv3 and GPLv3 is compatible with AGPLv3 (ie you can 
combine code of GPLv3 and AGPLv3 in the same project).

If we do this then any person who receives our combined GPLv3/AGPLv3 code has 
to obey both licenses (because it contains code both with GPLv3 and with 
AGPLv3). Which means that they will have to provide source code of their 
modifications to pvpgn (they can avoid this if they remove every AGPL code 
part from the project, possibly reimplementing those features themselves but 
this is very unlikely because if we change to AGPLv3 at least the code that 
aaron, Pelish and I have written then it is enough of code to make it very 
hard to remove it and rewrite it to avoid AGPL constraints).

Of course, there is also the issue that they can just ignore the license 
alltogether and act illegal about it, that is their choice but then they risk 
to be made fun of, appear in slashdot.org or even be sued by FSF lawyers :)

What do you think? (I would expect people who perform modifications and do not 
release to oppose this but I really do not care, I am interested about 
reasons against doing this that would hurt pvpgn and the development process, 
not reasons that hurt whatever random people who &quot;steal&quot; the code and don't 
give anything back)
